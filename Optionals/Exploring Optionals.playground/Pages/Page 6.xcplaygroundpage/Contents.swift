 ## Unwrapping optionals
 
 With this code:
 
 ![optional](optional.png)
 
 On line 22, a value was provided when `dayOfWeek` was initialized.
 
 On line 23, we checked for the absence of a value.
 
 On line 24, we printed the contents of the `dayOfWeek` variable.
 
 However, the variable `dayOfWeek` remained an optional, and so it was shown as such in the output.
 
 How can we use `dayOfWeek` like a regular variable?
 
 We must *unwrap* the optional variable.
 
 Type the code you see below â€“ note the changes within the first branch of the conditional statement.

 */
// Type the code below this line...
var dayOfWeek: String? = "Monday"
if dayOfWeek != nil{
    let day = dayOfWeek!
    print("The day is \(day)")
} else{
    print("No day was provided")
}

 Now, run the playground.
 
 Look closely at the output.

 **How does it differ from the output you obtained on page 5**?
 
 Go back to [page 5](@previous) and check if needed.
