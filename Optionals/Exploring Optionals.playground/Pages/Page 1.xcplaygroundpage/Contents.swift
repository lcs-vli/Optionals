 ## Variable initialization
 
 - Callout(Essential Question):
 What is the difference between an optional String and a regular String?
 
 ### Experiment #1
 Try typing the following code below on lines 19 and 20:
 
 ![declare-no-value](declare-no-value.png)
 
 Run the playground.
 
 What is the result?
 */
// Type the code below this line
//var myName: String
//print(myName)
/*:
 
 The debug area appeared at the bottom of your playground.
 
 Did you see output similar to the following?
 
 What do you think the error means?
 
 ![variable-not-initialized](error.png)
 
 ### Experiment #2
 
 Now comment out the code above from experiment #1.
 
 Then type the following instead:
 
 ![declare-optional](declare-optional.png)
 
 */
// Type the second code example below...
var yourName: String?
print(yourName)

/*:
 
 Run the playground again.
 
 You will notice a warning appears:
 
 ![coerced](coerced.png)
 
 Aside from that warning, focus on the result shown in the debug area.
 
 How does the result shown from the second block of code differ from the result you got when running the first block of code?
 
 Write a response to this question in your black notebook.
